</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Today, we'll talk about something quite exciting. We define a Turing machine that prints its own source code. This construction offers us insight into how one may construct quines in any programming language.</p>
<p>First, some quick definitions. A quine is a program that prints itself. At first this may seem impossible! A first attempt in python may look something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;print&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But wait. We missed the first print. So perhaps we'll add another print? But then we have</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;print &#39;print&#39;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and we have the problem we started with. Let's revisit this is a moment.</p>
<p>A Turing machine is an abstraction of a computer. It has some finite number of states, transitions between those states, and infinite memory. Excitingly, this turns out to be a quite reasonable definition of computation. There's a very important result in computer science called the Church-Turing Thesis, which basically says that anything your-programming-language-here can do, so can a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Consequently, offering a Turing machine quine is a way of offering a quine for every programming language! We'll find that it's actually quite instructive to talk about quines in the abstract first, before moving into specific programming languages.</p>
<p>Right. So let's get started. We present the following lemma:</p>
<p>There is a computable function q, where if w is some string, q(w) is a description of a Turing machine that prints out w and halts.</p>
<p>We offer the following TM as a construction of this function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Q</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;On input string w:</span>
    <span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="n">Construct</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">following</span> <span class="n">TM</span> <span class="n">P_w</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">P_w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;On any input:</span>
            <span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="n">Erase</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="nb">input</span>
            <span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="n">Write</span> <span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">tape</span>
            <span class="mf">3.</span> <span class="n">Halt</span><span class="s">&#39;</span>
    <span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">P_w</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So our TM Q takes a string w and outputs a TM that prints w. Perfect! Exactly what we wanted. We'll see why this is useful in a moment. Remember, this TM acts as a definition of a computable function, which we called q.</p>
<p>With this lemma in hand, we proceed to the main task: building a TM that prints itself. We'll split the machine up into two parts - A and B. Let's start with a description for A.</p>
<p>A's description depends on B, so let's assume we've written B. Remember the function q that we wrote earlier? We define A to be q(B). Which is to say, A is just a TM that, on any input, just prints a description of part B. This depends on our definition of B, so let's talk about that now.</p>
<p>B's the second and last part of the program, so at the end, we should have printed a full description of AB. By the time we get to B, A just ran, leaving a copy of B's source code sitting on the tape. Which means at this point, B has a description of itself. So then how do we get a description of A?</p>
<p>Here's the trick: we apply q to our description of B. By our definition, q(B) is a TM that, on any input, prints a copy of B. This was exactly our definition of part A!  So B takes its own source code and applies q to it, obtaining a description of A. Then B outputs AB, completing the proof.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">QUINE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;On input string w:</span>
    <span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;On input M, where M is a part of a TM:</span>
        <span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">M</span><span class="s">&#39;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Using this proof as a template, let's consider how we would write a quine in python. As before, let's consider part A first. Part A needs to give B a copy of B's source code. In the TM model, this was achieved by leaving a copy of B's description on the tape.</p>
<p>In python, we can just assign into a variable to achieve the same effect. So our part A should look something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&#39;s source code here&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Part B should print part A and then print part B. Something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;b = </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">b</span>  <span class="c"># Print part A</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">b</span>             <span class="c"># Then print part B</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Combining these two together (along with some careful tiptoe-ing around python formatting) yields:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;print &quot;b = </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s">&quot; % b; print b&#39;</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;b = </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And there you have it! A general guideline to make quines followed by an example. You are now equipped to go out and impress all your friends with your quine-making abilities. :P</p>                </article>
